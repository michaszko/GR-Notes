# My notes from General Relativity (summer 2020)

*notes.pdf* is main file where I wrote all the answers for GR problem session. All the plots were done by my with help of the internet (mostly stackoverflow). Every list is different chapter in *Chapter*. To compile *tex* files I use LuaLaTeX.

In *Visualizations* I put gifs I made in LaTeX to better understand some problems.  

* For written test 1 
![](Visualizations/Test_1/test.gif)

* For assigment 2
![](Visualizations/Ass2_prob5/ass2.gif)

* For assigment 5
![](Visualizations/Ass5_prob1/ass5.gif)

To produce *gif* from *pdf* I used  

``` bash
convert -density 300 -delay 10 -loop 0 -background white -alpha remove gif.pdf output.gif
```

I do not publish lists of problems since I am not sure if I am allowed to.
