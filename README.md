# My notes from General Relativity (summer 2020)

*notes.pdf* is main file where I wrote all the answers for GR problem session. All the plots were done by my with help of the internet (mostly stackoverflow). Every list is different chapter in *Chapter*. To compile tex files I use LuaLaTeX.

In *Visualizations* I put gifs I made in LaTeX to better understand some problems.

### For assigment 5

To produce gif from pdf I used  

``` bash
convert -density 300 -delay 10 -loop 0 -background white -alpha remove gif.pdf output.gif
```

I do not publish lists of problems since I am not sure if I am allowed to.
